        <h1>Watership Down</h1>
        <p>Watership Down, authored by Richard Adams, is a rich novel exploring the lives of a group of rabbits leaving
           their warren in pursuit of a safer place to live. The novel mixes fantasy and realism together, creating a 
           rich world of history for the rabbits, down to their own language and mythology. This book is one of my 
           absolute favorites because of how rich and detailed it is, whether that be in the character interactions, its 
           refusal to shy away from dark subject matter despite it being meant for all audiences, and its staunchly 
           environmentalist message about the destruction of ecosystems for profit.
